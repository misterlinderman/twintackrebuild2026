# TwinTack Grip Manager Changelog

> **Workflow documentation:** Native production workflow is documented in [`plugins/twintack-custom-grips/WORKFLOW.md`](../twintack-custom-grips/WORKFLOW.md). Monday.com / Make.com integrations are retired. Historical entries below describe legacy behavior.

## Version 1.7.06 - 2026-06-26

### Phase 1 — Retire Make.com / Monday.com integrations

- Removed Make.com webhook URLs and HTTP triggers from theme and Grip Manager
- Removed Monday.com REST API endpoint (`/twintack/v1/grip-design/{id}/monday`)
- Replaced outbound webhooks with WordPress actions: `grip_new_design_created`, `grip_customer_feedback_submitted`, `grip_production_approval`
- Monday admin meta box replaced with read-only **Legacy Monday.com Data** panel (historical meta only)
- Deleted `MONDAY-API.md`

---

## Version 1.7.05 - 2026-05-28

### Documentation & Workflow Alignment

- Removed **Production Ready** (`approved_for_production`) as a team-facing artwork status step
- WooCommerce order **Processing** now sets `in_production` directly (via `TTCG_Status` when Custom Grips is active)
- Monday.com API marked deprecated in `MONDAY-API.md`; native workflow is the source of truth
- Updated `CUSTOMER-FEEDBACK-SYSTEM.md` to reflect Custom Grips as primary customer/team experience

### 🧠 Intelligent Import - Smart Partial Data Handling

#### **Problem Identified**
User feedback: *"Obviously there is missing information, otherwise I wouldn't need to be using the tool to import the submission."*

The v1.7.00 importer was too strict - it would completely fail if ANY required field was missing, blocking the entire import. This defeated the purpose of having a manual creation tool.

#### **Solution Implemented**
Smart partial import that:
- ✅ **Always imports available data** - No more blocking errors
- ✅ **Identifies missing fields** - Lists exactly what needs manual entry
- ✅ **Visual highlighting** - Yellow background on fields needing attention
- ✅ **Helpful guidance** - Specific instructions for each missing field
- ✅ **Intelligent save behavior** - Only suggests auto-save when complete

#### **New Behavior**
```
Before: ❌ Error: Entry is missing team/school name [BLOCKED]

After:  ✓ Imported 8 fields from entry #849
        
        Missing 2 field(s):
        ⚠️ Team/School Name is REQUIRED - please add manually
        ⚠️ No artwork file uploaded in form - add via upload or URL
        
        → Please fill the highlighted fields above and save.
```

#### **Visual Improvements**
- **Warning Color**: Orange border/yellow background for partial imports
- **Success Color**: Green border/blue background for complete imports  
- **Field Highlighting**: Yellow background on empty required fields
- **Smart Messaging**: Shows count of imported vs missing fields

#### **User Benefits**
1. **Saves Time**: Import 11 fields, manually fill 1 (vs typing all 12)
2. **Reduces Errors**: Only manual fields can have typos
3. **Clear Guidance**: Specific list of what's missing
4. **Works Flexibly**: Handles any combination of present/missing data

#### **Technical Changes**
- Changed from hard validation failure to soft warning system
- Added `missing_fields` array tracking
- Enhanced response with `has_warnings` flag
- JavaScript now highlights empty fields and adjusts colors based on completeness
- Conditional save prompt based on data completeness

#### **Documentation**
- **New Guide**: `INTELLIGENT-IMPORT.md` - Complete explanation with examples
