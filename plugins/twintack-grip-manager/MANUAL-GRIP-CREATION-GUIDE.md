# Manual Grip Design Creation Guide

## Version 1.7.00 - Enhanced Admin Interface

This guide explains the new features for manually creating and managing grip design posts in the WordPress admin.

## Overview

The admin interface has been significantly enhanced to provide parity between automatically-created and manually-created grip design posts. You now have three powerful tools:

1. **Gravity Forms Importer** - Import data directly from form submissions
2. **Artwork Upload/URL** - Add artwork via upload or direct URL paste
3. **Complete Field Set** - All metadata fields available for manual entry

## New Features

## Tips & Best Practices

### For Manual Creation

1. **Always use Gravity Forms Importer when possible**
   - Most accurate
   - Fastest method
   - Complete data set

2. **Team Name is Critical**
   - Used in post title
   - Required for display and search
   - Cannot be empty

3. **Artwork URL Format**
   - Must be complete URL
   - Should start with `https://`
   - Gravity Forms format: `https://twintack.com/wp-content/uploads/gravity_forms/...`
   - Media Library format: `https://twintack.com/wp-content/uploads/YYYY/MM/filename.jpg`

4. **Linking to Orders**
   - Add Order ID for tracking
   - Helps with customer service
   - Maintains audit trail

### For Troubleshooting Failed Orders

1. **Check Order Status First**
   - Must be "Processing" or "Completed"
   - Check order notes for status history

2. **Verify Form Entry Exists**
   - Go to Gravity Forms → Entries
   - Search by customer email or date
   - Confirm entry has all data

3. **Missing Team Name**
   - Most common failure cause
   - Check form entry first
   - If missing, need to get from customer
   - Now required in form to prevent this

4. **Use Importer for Consistency**
   - Ensures proper field mapping
   - Matches automatic creation exactly
   - Reduces human error

## Troubleshooting

### "Entry not found" Error

**Cause:** Invalid entry ID or entry was deleted

**Solution:**
- Double-check entry ID
- Go to Gravity Forms → Entries to verify
- Try searching for entry by customer email

### "Entry is missing team/school name" Error

**Cause:** Form entry doesn't have team name field filled

**Solution:**
- Contact customer for team name
- Manually enter in "Team/School Name" field
- Don't use importer; fill fields manually instead

### Artwork Not Showing

**Cause:** Invalid URL or file doesn't exist

**Solution:**
- Check if URL is accessible in browser
- Try re-uploading file
- For Gravity Forms uploads, check if form entry still exists
- URL must be complete (include https://)

### Import Button Does Nothing

**Cause:** Gravity Forms not active or JavaScript error

**Solution:**
- Verify Gravity Forms is active
- Check browser console for errors
- Try refreshing the page
- Clear browser cache

|---------|-------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|

## Advanced Features

### Editing Automatically-Created Posts

You can edit any field in automatically-created grip posts:
- Update customer information
- Change artwork
- Modify quantities
- Add additional notes

All your changes are preserved and won't be overwritten.

### Bulk Operations

For multiple failed orders:
1. Create a list of entry IDs
2. For each entry:
   - Create new grip design
   - Use importer
   - Note order ID in system meta box
3. Save each post

### Integration with Existing Workflow

Manual posts work identically to automatic ones:
- Same artwork status workflow
- Same customer feedback system
- Same display in customer dashboard

## Security & Permissions

- Only users with `edit_posts` capability can create grip designs
- Only administrators can import from Gravity Forms
- AJAX requests are nonce-protected
- File uploads go through WordPress media security

## Common Questions

**Q: Will manually created posts appear in customer dashboards?**
A: Yes, as long as the customer email matches their account.

**Q: Can I trigger an external webhook after manual creation?**
A: No. Make.com / Monday.com integrations were removed in Phase 1. New grip designs fire the `grip_new_design_created` WordPress action for any custom hooks you add.

**Q: What if I enter the wrong entry ID?**
A: The importer validates the entry exists. If wrong entry is imported, simply import the correct one - it will overwrite the data.

**Q: Can I create grip posts without any form submission?**
A: Yes, manually enter all required fields. Leave form entry ID blank.

**Q: Do I need to match the order ID?**
A: For tracking purposes, yes. But it's not required for the grip post to function.
